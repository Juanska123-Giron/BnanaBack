# **node-addon-api module**
This module contains  **header-only C++ wrapper classes** which simplify
the use of the C based [Node-API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/n-api.html)
provided by Node.js when using C++. It provides a C++ object model
and exception handling semantics with low overhead.

There are three options for implementing addons: Node-API, nan, or direct
use of internal V8, libuv, and Node.js libraries. Unless there is a need for
direct access to functionality that is not exposed by Node-API as outlined
in [C/C++ addons](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/addons.html)
in Node.js core, use Node-API. Refer to
[C/C++ addons with Node-API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/n-api.html)
for more information on Node-API.

Node-API is an ABI stable C interface provided by Node.js for building native
addons. It is independent of the underlying JavaScript runtime (e.g. V8 or ChakraCore)
and is maintained as part of Node.js itself. It is intended to insulate
native addons from changes in the underlying JavaScript e
